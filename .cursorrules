# Vercel Web Scripts - Cursor Rules

## Important: Read Project Documentation First

Before writing or modifying any code, **you must** read the project's `README.md` or `README.zh-CN.md` to understand the project functionality, environment variable configuration, etc.

## Code Standards

> **Note**: General coding standards (JSDoc comments, function export format, test naming) are managed via Cursor Skills. The agent will automatically apply these standards when writing code.

### Project-Specific Standards

- Follow the project's directory structure conventions
- Utility functions should be placed in dedicated directories (e.g., `utils/`)
- Internal helper functions are not exported

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Testing**: Jest + Playwright
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Commitlint

## Workflow

1. **Before starting to code**:
   - Read the project's README documentation
   - Understand the project structure and environment variable configuration

2. **When writing code**:
   - Follow coding standards (enforced via Cursor Skills)
   - Follow the project's directory structure conventions

3. **Before committing code**:
   - Code must comply with ESLint standards
   - Commit messages must comply with Commitlint standards
   - Tests must pass (if tests exist)
